# COALFIREASSESMENT

 
I started off This project with the vision of creating all of the resources manually then making custom modules out of them (more so as a challenge to myself instead of using modules from the registry). I ran into some issues with ALB. Due to prior engagements scheduled  I was not able to troubleshoot or  complete the drawing due to time constraints.  however I still decided to send what i did complete.  ( I purposely kept the .tfvars file in .gitignore so you can view the variable resolution)
